# ToyPetMe Virtual Pet Game

## Overview
ToyPetMe is a free, viral-friendly virtual pet game inspired by Tamagotchi, delivered as a mobile-first web application. No sign-up required — players visit and play instantly. Progress is saved in the browser (localStorage). The game features 5 unique pet species with 4 evolution stages each, a stat-based care system (hunger, happiness, energy, cleanliness), 3 client-side mini-games, a daily streak system, 27 achievements, social sharing, and ad slots for monetization. Designed for maximum SEO and viral reach.

## Architecture: Client-First + Stripe Payments

### Key Principle
- **100% client-side game logic** — all state stored in `localStorage` (`toypetme_v2` key)
- **No login/auth required** — players play immediately
- **Stripe payments** — optional £0.99 Premium + coin packs via Stripe guest checkout (no account needed)
- **Premium stored in localStorage** (`toypetme_premium = "1"`) after verified Stripe checkout
- **Stripe integration** managed by Replit's native Stripe connector + `stripe-replit-sync`

### Server
- `server/index.ts` — Express server with Stripe webhook (registered BEFORE express.json), Stripe schema init
- `server/routes.ts` — `/api/health`, `/api/products`, `/api/checkout/session`, `/api/checkout/verify`
- `server/stripeClient.ts` — Fetches Stripe credentials from Replit connector API
- `server/webhookHandlers.ts` — Processes Stripe webhooks via stripe-replit-sync
- `server/db.ts` — Drizzle ORM client (PostgreSQL, for stripe-replit-sync schema)
- `scripts/seed-products.ts` — Creates ToyPetMe products in Stripe (run manually)
