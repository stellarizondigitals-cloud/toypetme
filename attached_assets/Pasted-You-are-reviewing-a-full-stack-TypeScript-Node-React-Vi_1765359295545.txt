You are reviewing a full‑stack TypeScript/Node/React/Vite/Express project called "TOYPETME". The stack is:

- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite
- Backend: Express + TypeScript
- Database: Supabase (Postgres) with RLS enabled on users, pets, inventory, user_challenges, user_mini_game_sessions, breeding_records, and read‑only config tables (mini_games, shop_items, eggs, challenges).

Please:

1. Scan the project for build/runtime problems
   - Check TypeScript errors on both client and server.
   - Verify that all imports resolve (no missing files or modules).
   - Confirm `npm run build` and `npm run dev` should succeed for both client and server.
   - Highlight any obvious issues that would break deploys on Vercel (serverless Express handler, `vercel.json`, etc.).

2. Check backend behavior
   - Verify the main Express entry point (api/index.ts or server/index.ts) exports a handler compatible with Vercel.
   - Confirm API routes used by the frontend actually exist (e.g., auth, pets, inventory, challenges, mini‑games, breeding, etc.).
   - Look for unhandled promise rejections, missing `await`, or unprotected routes that should rely on Supabase RLS.

3. Check Supabase integration
   - Ensure environment variables are correctly referenced (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY or service role key, DATABASE_URL, etc.).
   - Verify queries include the correct `user_id` / `auth` context to match the RLS policies (users.id and all user_* tables store user IDs as text/varchar).
   - Flag any queries that would now fail with “permission denied” under the new RLS rules.

4. Check frontend logic
   - Confirm login / signup flows, pet loading, inventory, challenges, mini‑game sessions, and breeding features call the correct backend routes.
   - Look for obvious React errors (invalid hooks usage, missing keys, etc.) that would cause runtime crashes.
   - Ensure URLs used in the client match the deployed Vercel host and API paths.

5. Summarize
   - List any **errors or high‑risk issues** that would prevent TOYPETME from working correctly.
   - List **warnings / cleanup suggestions** (non‑critical).
   - If everything looks OK, explicitly say: “TOYPETME should build and run without errors given the current configuration.”
