Perfect! ✅ Created vercel.json at the project root. Here's what each key does:

📋 vercel.json Explained
"version": 2
Specifies Vercel platform version
Version 2 supports modern features (rewrites, serverless functions, etc.)
Required for all new Vercel projects
"buildCommand": "npm run build"
Tells Vercel how to build your app
Runs: vite build && esbuild server/index.ts ...
Output: Frontend (dist/public/) + Backend (dist/index.js)
"outputDirectory": "dist/public"
Directory containing static files to serve
Vercel uploads this to CDN/edge network
Contains: HTML, CSS, JS, images from your React frontend
"framework": null
null = No framework detection (custom setup)
Set to null because you're using custom Express.js (not Next.js/etc.)
Vercel won't auto-configure; it uses your build command instead
"rewrites" (URL routing)
These intercept requests and route them properly:

First rewrite:

{
  "source": "/api/(.*)",
  "destination": "/api/index.js"
}

Any request to /api/* → routed to your Express backend (dist/index.js)
Example: /api/auth/signup → handled by backend API routes
Second rewrite:

{
  "source": "/(.*)",
  "destination": "/index.html"
}

Any other request → serves index.html (React frontend)
Enables client-side routing (Wouter handles routes in React)
Example: / → /index.html → React app renders appropriate page
"functions" (Serverless config)
{
  "api/index.js": {
    "runtime": "nodejs18.x",
    "maxDuration": 10
  }
}

"api/index.js" - Path to your backend bundle
"runtime": "nodejs18.x" - Node.js version (18.x for modern features)
"maxDuration": 10 - Function timeout: 10 seconds max
Free tier limit: 10 seconds
Pro tier allows up to 60 seconds
Your API routes must complete within 10 seconds
🔄 How It Works Together
Request to https://toypetme.vercel.app:
  │
  ├─ /api/pets → Rewrite to api/index.js → Express backend handles
  │
  ├─ /game/memory → Rewrite to index.html → React renders game page
  │
  └─ / → Rewrite to index.html → React renders home page

✅ Your Vercel Config is Ready!
With this vercel.json:

✅ Frontend (React) serves static files from CDN (fast)
✅ Backend (Express API) runs as serverless function (scalable)
✅ Routing works: /api/* → backend, everything else → frontend
✅ 10-second timeout is plenty for your pet actions & database queries
✅ 100% free-tier compatible
Next step: Push to GitHub and deploy to Vercel! 🚀
