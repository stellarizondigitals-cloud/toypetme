Prompt to Replit: identify ToypetMe stack and deployment
I need a clear technical summary of this Replit project so I can migrate it and make sure it stays on free tiers only.
Please inspect the project files and answer the following questions in detail:
Frontend stack
Is the app using pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript, React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, or something else?
Which framework/library is the main entry point (e.g., src/main.tsx, src/App.tsx, pages/index.tsx)?
Backend / server stack
Is there a custom Node.js backend (e.g., Express, Fastify, Nest, tRPC) or is it a frontend‑only app?
List any server files you find (for example server/index.ts, server.ts, api/*.ts, or routes/*.ts) and say what they do.
Build system & tooling
Which build tool is used (Vite, Webpack, Next.js built‑in, CRA, etc.)?
Show the full "scripts" section from package.json and briefly explain what each script does (dev, build, start, prod, etc.).
Databases & external services
Which databases or storage services are referenced (e.g., Supabase, Firebase, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)?
List any API services or SDKs used (e.g., Google Gemini, Stripe, email providers).
For each one, tell me whether it can run on a free tier and what its typical free limits are (if known).
Current deployment assumptions
Based on the code and scripts, what deployment environment does this project appear to target (Replit Reserved VM, Vercel, Netlify, static hosting, etc.)?
Which commands are intended to run in production (for example npm run prod vs npm run start)?
Does the app expect a long‑running server process or can it run as a static / serverless site?
Ports, environment variables, and secrets
What port does the server listen on by default?
List all environment variables (process.env.*) used in the code and explain what each is for (especially API keys such as Google Gemini).
Free‑tier suitability
Given everything above, explain whether this project can be hosted fully on free tiers (for both frontend and backend).
If any part clearly requires a paid VM (e.g., Replit Reserved VM), highlight it and suggest how it could be restructured to work on free hosting (for example, static frontend + serverless API + free database).
Please format the answer as a structured report with numbered headings 1–7 so I can quickly see the full stack and deployment requirements for ToypetMe.com.
