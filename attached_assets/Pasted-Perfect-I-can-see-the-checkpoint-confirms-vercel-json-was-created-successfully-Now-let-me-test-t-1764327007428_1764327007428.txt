✅ COMPLETE: Vercel Deployment Preparation
I've successfully prepared your ToyPetMe app for production deployment on Vercel with 100% free-tier infrastructure:

What was completed this round:

Cleaned up dependencies - Uninstalled the unused @neondatabase/serverless package (no longer needed since switching to generic PostgreSQL for Supabase)

Created vercel.json - Your deployment configuration file is ready with proper Node.js runtime, 10-second timeout, and rewrites for API/frontend routing

Tested the build - Ran npm run build successfully:

Frontend: 1.3 MB (Vite build)
Backend: 133 KB (ESBuild bundle)
Total: ~1.4 MB for production
✅ No build errors
Created deployment guides:

VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md - Step-by-step instructions for GitHub + Vercel deployment
FREE_TIER_SETUP_TOYPETME.md - Complete free-tier architecture guide (already created earlier)
Updated replit.md with deployment status
Your app is now production-ready:

✅ Database: Supabase PostgreSQL (migrated via npm run db:push)
✅ Sessions: Persistent (PostgreSQL-backed)
✅ Backend: Express.js on port 5000
✅ Frontend: React + Vite build optimized
✅ Cost: $0/month (Replit dev + GitHub + Vercel + Supabase all free)
Next steps you can do anytime:

Push your code to GitHub (git add . && git commit && git push)
Deploy to Vercel (import repo, set env vars, deploy)
Follow VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md for detailed instructions
Everything is configured and ready! 🚀
